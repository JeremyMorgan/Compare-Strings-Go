# Compare Strings in Go

A simple demonstration of comparing two strings in Go. 

This is the example code from this blog post, [How Do I Compare Strings in Go?](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/go/string-comparison-golang/)

This is a work in progress. 

To time each function, uncomment them. 

Then run 

```
time go run csvcompare.go
```

or 

```
go build csvcompare.go
time csvcompare
```

As a warning, if you compile it, the application will run faster and it's harder to find the differences. Compiler optimization is neat.
